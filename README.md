About the game

MyoSnake is a Javascript Web game that let you play a classic snake game with a Myo Armband. 

You can play the game online on http://myosnake.life.

To run it locally, you can download our repo and open ```index.html```

You can either use traditional direction key to control, or if you have a Myo Armband, you can control the snake via your arm and finger gesture. You are controlling a snake that can move in all four directions. Your goal is to eat as many food and grow as long as possible. But keep in mind, the snake will die if it hit itself or the border.
